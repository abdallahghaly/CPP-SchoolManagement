# School Management Project (C++)

This is a simple **School Management System** project implemented in **C++**.  
It demonstrates the use of:

- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- File Handling
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Basic OOP Concepts

## Project Files

- `school.cpp` → Main program
- `student.h` → Student class with destructor
- `subjects.h` → Subject class
- `input.txt` → Sample input data
- `output.txt` → Output results

## Features

- Read student data from a file
- Store student subjects dynamically
- Calculate total percentage for each student
- Write results to output file

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Build and run the solution.
3. Make sure `input.txt` is in the same folder as the executable.
4. Results will be saved in `output.txt`.

## Notes

- Demonstrates memory management using `new` and `delete`.
- Good practice for beginners in C++ OOP and file handling.
